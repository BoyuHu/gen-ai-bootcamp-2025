### 💡 Clues and Considerations

1. First sentence:

   * Start with "this morning" as time.
   * Use the word for “you” (which in Japanese is often omitted unless emphasis is needed).
   * Think about the past tense of "to see."
   * The object is “raven.”

2. Second sentence:

   * Start with “garden” as location.
   * The subject is “they” (implied by context, use plural or animate subject form if needed).
   * Use the verb “to look at.”
   * You need to decide the polite/past/progressive form yourself.

### 🕵️ Let’s Review

#### ✅ Good things:

* You correctly started with **朝** (morning) in sentence 1 — nice!
* You're placing the **subject, object, and verb** together — solid beginner effort.

#### ❗Things to fix:

##### Sentence 1: 朝鴉見る

* You need a **subject** (even if implied) — who is doing the seeing?
* The **particles** are missing — they are essential in Japanese to show function (like “who sees what”).
* Word order for clarity would be: **\[Time] \[Subject] \[Object] \[Verb]**

  * So: 朝 (time), あなた (subject), 鴉 (object), 見る (verb)

##### Sentence 2: 私たち庭鴉見る

* Seems like you want to say: “They were looking at **our** garden”
* But right now it reads more like: “We garden raven see”
* You need:

  * correct **location marker** for the garden (use the right particle)
  * better subject reference for “they”
  * correct form of “見る” if you want to express ongoing action

### 📌 Suggestions to Revise

Here’s how you might **restructure** while following:

* Sentence 1: \[Time] \[Subject] \[Object] \[Verb]
* Sentence 2: \[Location] \[Subject] \[Object] \[Verb]

Try again using:

* 朝
* 私たちの庭
* 鴉
* 見る
* (maybe あなた, or implied subject)
