### functional requirements

the company want to invest in owning infrastructure.
the reason is because thre is a conceren about the privacy of user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for genai will greatly raise in cost.

they want to invest an ai pc where they can afford spend of 10-15k.
they have 300 active students, and students are located within the city of Nagasaki.

### assumptions
we are assuming that the open-source llms that we choose will be powerful enough to run the hardware with an investment of 10-15k.


we're just going to hook up a single serve in our office to the internet and serve the 300 students.

### data strategy
there is a concern of copyright materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

### considerations
we're considering using ibm grantie becauase its a truly open-source model with training data that is traceble so we can avoid any copyright issues and we are able to know what is going on in the model.
